			<h2>Recipies-World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h2>
			<p>
				I adapted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Grainger .Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<pow>st</pow> visit to Bill's restraunt in Kings Cross,
				Sydney. I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.
			</p>
			<p>
				This recipe is what I call a "very special breakfast", just look at the ingredients to see why it has to be tasted to be believed.
